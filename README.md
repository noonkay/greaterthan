#Greater Than Podcast Website

##About the Project
>Greater than is a storytelling platform that tells stories about people and organizations that overcome, that keep on despite the desolation they've seen or been through. Greater Than asks thought provoking questions about using stories to tackle systems of injustice, inequality, racism, poverty, and shift narratives?

This is a design and development effort to transform and improve the look and feel of the existing website

##Technology
